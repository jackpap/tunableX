"""Tests that only tunable parameters have their annotations evaluated.

Historically the decorator called get_type_hints(fn) which eagerly resolves
all annotations. This breaks when non-tunable params reference names that only
exist under TYPE_CHECKING or simply are missing at runtime.

This test defines a function with:
  - a tunable param 'a' (selected explicitly)
  - a non-tunable param 'b' whose annotation is a forward ref to an undefined symbol
If the decorator still eagerly evaluated all annotations the decoration would
raise NameError. The lazy implementation should ignore 'b' and succeed.
